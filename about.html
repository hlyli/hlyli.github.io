            WHO AM I?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Haley. I was born in and currently reside in Vancouver, BC. I am an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia majoring in computer science and mathematics.

            COMPUTER SCIENCE
        </h4>
        <p>
            As a computer science student, I have had the time to experience many wonderful aspects of the field. The satisfaction of being able to apply my knowledge and experience to solve new problems keeps programming interesting to me. Computer science is a field where I can learn new things every day and can see many applications to it in the everyday world.

        <h4 style="text-align: center">
            MATHEMATICS
        </h4>
        <p>
            Mathematics has always been an interest of mine. I love how it integrates into almost all aspects of life. I'm always amazed at how far I've progressed in mathematics. It feels incredible to think that 8 years ago, I was beginning to learn algebra, and now I've moved onto the university-level proofs, calculus, differential equations, and more!
        </p>
        <p>
            What's amazing about math is how it can appear anywhere, even in the most random of applications. My favourite is <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Pi-by-Throwing-Frozen-Hot-Dogs">approximating pi by throwing hot dogs into a square with a circle inscribed in it</a>. Such a process is based on Monte Carlo integration.

            GRAPHIC DESIGN
        </h4>
        <p>
            Graphic design is my passion. I've always enjoyed working in Photoshop/Illustrator/Lightroom. Manipulating images and creating visuals from scratch is an incredible way to express myself artistically and creatively. I always loved attending my graphic design class in high school, where I worked on various projects, particularly the yearbook cover.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center">
            PHOTOGRAPHY
        </h4>
        <p>
            Photography is another creative outlet of mine. I love how well it meshes with graphic design as I am able to work with the photos that I take using Lightroom then apply editing techniques that I've learned. I still have a lot to learn, but the existence of RAW image formats allow me to experiment and improve. I currently use a Sony a6000 to take most of my photos.
