    "I am a senior research engineer at Huawei Canada's Intelligent Cloud Infrastructure Lab. My current focus is on LLM inference optimization and asynchronous RL fine-tuning for large-scale MoE models. I previously completed my M.Sc in computer science at the University of British Columbia, where I applied reinforcement learning techniques to load balancing and scheduling for serverless and search engines.",
