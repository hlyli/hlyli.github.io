# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** <br>

I am a M.Sc. computer science graduate from the University of British Columbia. Particularly, my interests are machine learning and systems. I worked on load balancing and scheduling using reinforcement learning algorithms in serverless and search engines. I currently work on machine learning serving optimization.
