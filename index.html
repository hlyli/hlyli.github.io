                Hi, I'm a computer science graduate student (MSc) at the University of British Columbia. I am currently
                working on maximizing revenue from spot instances in cloud systems through machine learning and
                cooperative scheduling policies. I completed my undergrad in computer science and mathematics in 2021 at
                the University of British Columbia.

                At the <a href="https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/">Systopia Lab</a>, I am working on datacenter scheduling.
                Particularly, we are trying to improve revenue gain through increased spot instance (SI) utilisation. We
                can achieve this through a cooperative framework that communicates SI preferences to the VM scheduler,
                which allows us to improve SI scheduling with little to no cost to VM scheduling performance.
                Additionally, we investigated more intelligent eviction policies using machine learning. With predicted
                VM lifetimes, we can determine when a VM is expected to depart, which we can use in making scheduling
                decisions.
